However, their quantization remains challenging due to their non-renormalizable nature."},{"heading":"Classical General Relativity and Quantum Divergences","content":"The classical theory of general relativity is a successful description of gravitational interactions at the macroscopic level. However, when considered in quantum terms, it encounters divergent results due to its infinite self-interaction terms."},{"heading":"Renormalization Techniques","content":"The difficulty in quantizing gravity has led researchers to employ renormalization techniques. Perturbative methods allow for the expansion of the theory around a classical background, but still produce divergent results."},{"heading":"Alternative Approaches","content":"Alternative theories such as string theory and loop quantum gravity have been proposed as potential solutions to the renormalizability problem. These approaches aim to provide a well-defined quantum theory of gravity, with promising results in certain regimes."},{"heading":"Conclusion","content":"The quest for a renormalizable quantum gravity theory remains an active area of research. The study of gravitational interactions continues to push the boundaries of our understanding, with implications for both cosmology and particle physics."}],"references":[{"title":"Donoghue, J.
